# sshhh-o-matic
---
This repository has the code for sshhh-o-matic. sshhh-o-matic is a project developed during [XING]'s 10th hackweek and it's purpose is to reduce the amount of noise produced in an open office environment.

It requires Android Things, a USB microphone and speakers in order to fully function.

This project is highly inspired on [Gautier]'s project (huge kudos :pray:) with some modifications.

You'll find a working demo [here].
